## Description

A simple MERN application that allows a user to add and remove workouts, will add authentication and routes for individual users at a later time. The backend makes use of Mongoose to talk to the MongoDB database as well as to authenticate that all data being passed to the controllers is valid, if it is not valid, an error will be presented to the user as well as using CSS to highlight the required fields. On the frontend it makes use of React useContext to interact with the API depending on the context that is passed to the reducer and carrying out the necessary request and then updating the state.

## Notes

- The application follows the tutorial listed above, however, I added code necessary to host it online using a server hosted on Google Cloud platform so that I could also practice deploying a MERN application.
- I was able to follow most of the steps from [Brad Traversy's](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia) tutorial [Linux Server Setup & MERN Deployment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aRjGIhwyQM), however, I used a Google Cloud VM instance which presented several issues not covered in Brad's tutorial.

## Setting up the app

- `cd` into each of the subdirectories and run `npm install` to add the necessary packages
- Contact developer so that I can temporarily allow all connections to database otherwise the application will not properly connect to the Mongo database

## Running app

- `cd server` `npm run dev` - Start API server and connects to the database
- From a second terminal window, `cd frontend` `npm start` - Starts React frontend
